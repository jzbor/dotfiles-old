# My Dotfiles

## Idea for new build concept:
1. User chooses bricks in relevant order
2. User chooses device
3. Script saves config for later rebuild
4. Script builds into given dir
    1. If a .git folder exists the repo gets updated
    2. If there is no such folder a repo gets initialised in the folder
    3. The user wishes not to create a git repo

* Create config file for behavior like automatic pushing, repo creation etc.
