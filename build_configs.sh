# Idea:
# 1. User chooses bricks in relevant order
# 2. User chooses device
# 3. Script saves config for later rebuild
# 4. Script builds into given dir
#   4.a if a .git folder exists the repo gets updated
#   4.b if there is no such folder a repo gets initialised in the folder
#   4.c The user wishes not to create a git repo
#
# * Create config file for behavior like automatic pushing, repo creation etc.
